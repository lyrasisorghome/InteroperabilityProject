# Interoperability Project

The CST Interoperability Project is an initiative of the Lyrasis Organizational Home, supported by the Lyrasis CST Growth Fund, faciliated by Jessical Farrell of RedStart Consulting.

Under the guidance of the Organizational Home and in close consultation with the communities, this project is designed to equitably support each of these important technologies, and center community, sustainability, and interoperability.

This repository will be used to collaborate on the work products.

The first phase of the project is to define functional requirements for interoperability workflows.
