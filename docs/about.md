<hr><center></center>
<p>This project is one of the initiatives supported by the CST Growth Fund,  a million-dollar investment from Lyrasisâ€™ reserves designed to help community-supported technologies (CSTs) grow for the future.</p>

<p>Under the guidance of the Organizational Home and in close consultation with the communities, this project is designed to equitably support  each of these important technologies, and center community, sustainability, and interoperability.</p>

<p>The first phase of the project is to define functional requirements for interoperability workflows. This website shares information and updates as the project develops. Jessica Farrell of Redstart Works, a digital archives consultancy, has been retained to work on this portion of the project and manages the website.</p>
