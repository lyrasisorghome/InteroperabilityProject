### Project Kickoff at the Organizational Home Cross-Chairs Meeting

We were fortunate to time our project kick-off with the Fall quarterly Organizational Cross-Chairs Meeting where all the Chairs and Vice Chairs of Lyrasis CSTs get together. On Oct. 15, 2025, we shared the primary goals, deadlines, and engagement points for the Interoperability project.
