## Project Updates

### Fall Feedback Sessions
The [feedback](feedback.md) process has taken shape:

1. Generate ideas
2. Generate conversation about ideas
3. Generate solutions

#### Generating Ideas
We are nearing the end of the idea generation process. The CST communities have a long history of documentation and conversations about integrations and feature requests. We first generated ideas from past documentation.

##### Workshops

Then we held a series of workshops with each CST community, and a two-day blitz of workshops that members of any Lyrasis CST community could participate in to solicit ideas.

##### Survey
We developed and released a survey. Anyone involved in a Lyrasis CST is invited to fill out the survey. We hope the survey will generate further ideas, more information about existing integrations, and feedback on other interoperability-related program needs. **The survey is open until Jan. 15**, so fill out the one for your respective community now!:

- ArchivesSpace (link)
- CollectionSpace (link)
- DSpace (link)
- Fedora (link)
- VIVO (link)

Please help us spread the word about your community’s survey: Share it with other users of your community technology, or post it on your favorite social media platform.

#### Generating Conversation about Ideas
We are now discussing high level ideas to identify discrete solutions we can design. If you are a Lyrasis CST community member, you are invited to participate in conversations about proposed solutions. You have two pathways to participate.

- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/lyrasisorghome/InteroperabilityProject/issues)
- [Email List](https://groups.google.com/a/lyrasislists.org/g/cst-interoperability)

#### Generating Designs
Once solutions are identified, we will work together to draft descriptions and user behavior scenarios using a Behavior-Driven Design (BDD) process. Again, there are two ways to participate in defining user behavior:

- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/lyrasisorghome/InteroperabilityProject/issues)
- [Email List](https://groups.google.com/a/lyrasislists.org/g/cst-interoperability)

The ideas that make it through these steps of the feedback process will be considered for developing functional requirements. The CST Interoperability consultant will propose one solution to each community's governance team. We will select up to five solutions total (at least one for each CST) with a target decision date of January 30. 

Check the [GitHub Project] (https://github.com/orgs/lyrasisorghome/projects/1) to see ideas moving through the refinement process. Stay tuned to see what amazing ideas make it to the top!

### Project Kickoff at the Organizational Home Cross-Chairs Meeting

We were fortunate to time our project kick-off with the Fall quarterly Organizational Cross-Chairs Meeting where all the Chairs and Vice Chairs of Lyrasis CSTs get together. On Oct. 15, 2025, we shared the primary goals, deadlines, and engagement points for the Interoperability project.

The [meeting slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-wC_FNy68yYaf2rutW2vL5U0QC7_AtRm402EiPyHyxA/edit?slide=id.g36900fdbd32_0_0#slide=id.g36900fdbd32_0_0) include a summary of this information.
