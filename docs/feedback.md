# Integration Selection Feedback
There are many ways to provide feedback on integration ideas to be considered in the Lyrasis CST Interoperability project.

Each Lyrasis CST will receive development support for at least *one* integration.

To select an integration, the feedback process has these steps:
1. Generate ideas
2. Generate conversation about ideas
3. Generate solutions
4. Proposal & Community governance decision

## Generating Ideas (Oct - Dec 2025)
<p>There are 4 ways to generate and submit ideas:</p>

1. Attend a workshop in November or December 2025
2. Fill out the survey:
    - [ArchivesSpace](link)
    - [CollectionSpace](link)
    - [DSpace](link)
    - [Fedora](link)
    - [VIVO](link)

3. [Submit an Idea via GitHub Issues](https://github.com/lyrasisorghome/InteroperabilityProject/issues)</p>
4. Email jessica.farrell-ctr@lyrasis.org

Some ideas were also generated from past community conversations which were documented on websites or listservs.

## Generating Conversation and Solutions (Dec 2025 - Jan 2026)
Generated ideas are posted to GitHub Issues and an email list. The ideas are refined into discrete solutions.

- Join the discussion at [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/lyrasisorghome/InteroperabilityProject/issues)
- Join the discussion at the [cst-interoperability email group](https://groups.google.com/a/lyrasislists.org/g/cst-interoperability).

## Proposal and Decision
The CST Interoperability consultant will review feedback generated from these sources and make a proposal to each community's leadership. The target date for finalizing this decision is Feb. 9, 2026.

# Designing Integrations Together
_*Feb-May 2026*_

Once solutions are identified in the first phase of the project, we will draft descriptions and user behavior scenarios using a Behavior-Driven Design (BDD) process. There are two ways to participate in defining user behavior.
